# TV Shows Database

This ReactJS app utilizes [TV Maze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) to allow users to search TVs by their titles. 

A fuzzy algorithm is used (with a fuzziness value of 2), meaning that shows will still be found even if the query contains small typos. Results are returned in order of relevancy (best matches on top) and contain each show's information.
